### This is a capstone project for the Galvanize Web Development Immersive and a work in progress.

### Watch a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1G2psbj_ok&feature=youtu.be "here").

### Run the app in the Expo simulator with `npm start` or `yarn start`

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
# or
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
